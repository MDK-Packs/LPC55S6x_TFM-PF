TF-M with Bootloader Project Template
-------------------------------------

Target: NXP LPCXpresso55S69 Development Board

Workspace contains the following projects:
 - bl2:    Bootloader (TF-M MCUBoot)
 - tfm_s:  TF-M firmware with secure services running on the secure side
 - tfm_ns: Template for application running on the non-secure side

Bootloader runs first and searches for a valid image containing TF-M firmware.
If image is found and authenticated it then boots into TF-M firmware which runs
next and then transfers execution to the non-secure application.

Secure side image (tfm_s) and non-secure side image (tfm_ns) are signed and
encapsulated with header and trailer during post build process.
The following external tools are required:
 - python + imgtool (>=1.7.0)
The above executables need to be in the command line path.

Running the example:
 - connect the board via USB Debug Link Port to the PC
 - use console on the PC via UART @115200bps (optional)
 - build project for the Bootloader (bl2) and flash to target
 - build project for the secure side (tfm_s) and flash to target
 - build project for the non-secure side (tfm_ns) and flash to target
 - start the debug session and run the target
